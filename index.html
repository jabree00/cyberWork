  <h1>A Simple Blog written by a Simple Lady</h1>
  <p>The goal of this blog is to document my learning as a PerScholas cybersecurity training. Hopefully, it will help more DIY doers (like me) get the job done! </p>
  <p>I am building these pages with raw html, so excuse the simplicity :D. The point is to get focus on the skills, not the frills. </p>
